# golo-book
A book on real world Golo usage and example recipes.

The purpose of this book is to be an equivalent of “Real World X”, “X Cookbook” or “X in Action” books that can be found for other languages. It will try to explain core Golo concepts, maybe even Golo internals, and present usage examples for concrete use cases or patterns.
